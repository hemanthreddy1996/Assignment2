     <h3>Introduction to Recipe Rating System Chart</h3>
     <p>In order to better help you identify recipes that feature a high concentration of nutrients for the calories they
        contain, we created a Recipe Rating System. This system allows us to highlight the recipes that are especially rich
        in particular nutrients. The following chart shows the nutrients for which 15-Minute Greek Garbanzo Bean Salad is either
        an excellent, very good, or good source (below the chart you will find a table that explains these qualifications). If a
        nutrient is not listed in the chart, it does not necessarily mean that the recipe doesn't contain it. It simply means
        that the nutrient is not provided in a sufficient amount or concentration to meet our rating criteria. (To view this
        recipe's in-depth nutritional profile that includes values for dozens of nutrients - not just the ones rated as excellent,
        very good, or good - please use the link below the chart.) To read this chart accurately, you'll need to glance back up
        to see the ingredients used in the recipe and the number of serving sizes provided by the recipe. Our nutrient ratings are
        based on a single serving. For example, if a recipe makes 4 servings, you would be receiving the nutrient amounts listed
        in the chart by eating 1/4th of the combined ingredients found in the recipe. Now, returning to the chart itself, you can
        look next to the nutrient name in order to find the nutrient amount it offers, the percent Daily Value (DV%) that this
        amount represents, the nutrient density that we calculated for this recipe and nutrient, and the rating we established
        in our rating system. For most of our nutrient ratings, we adopted the government standards for food labeling that are
        found in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's "Reference Values for Nutrition Labeling."Read more background
        information and details of our rating system.</p>
